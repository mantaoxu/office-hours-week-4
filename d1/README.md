# Learning Objectives -  Browser Basics

- Explain the difference between the BOM (browser object model) and the DOM(document object model).
  1. The DOM is the API used to access the elements inside the document
  2. The BOM is a larger representation of everything provided by the browser, including the current document
  - DOM(Document Object Model):
    - Interface that allows us to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of a website
    - JS is the client-side scripting language that connects to the DOM in a browser
    - Defines HTML elements as objects and gives them properties, methods, and events
  - BOM(Browser Object Model):
    - Larger representation of everything provided by the browser, including the current document, location, history, frame, and any other functionality the browser may expose to JS.
